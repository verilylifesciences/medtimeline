There are three asset types in this folder:

1. In demo_data, each folder contains a set of test data that you can load into
  MedTimeLine to see how it looks without having to add any FHIR calls.
  Please see angular.json under the "configurations" sections to trace
  how to serve MedTimeLine with the demo files.

2. In images, there are images for the in-app tutorial for MedTimeLine.

3. In tools, you will find utility scripts for working with various assets.
