## Versions

### 1.0.2.0
* For some reason the microbiology error message is tripping over finding this object's label so we can't debug it because it won't render the error message. We remove the label from the error message in hopes of getting more to debug with.
* Issue #16: Add Encounters error message to setup screen
* Issue #12: Print xrequestID in debug info on the card
* Clarify and simplify display range calculations for graphs.
* Fix e2e tests by implementing a previously overlooked function.
* Upgrade dev dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
* Added the shorter time options (#9). e2e tests currently on local; did not push.
* Ordered concepts in CBC (#5)
* Upgrade packages.
* Issue #10: Show concept label if it fails to load
* Remove resource count for faster FHIR calls. Clean up a few imports.
